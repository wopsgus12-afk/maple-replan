/**
 * English guide posts (GMS / English search).

 * How to add a post:
 * 1. Append an object to EN_GUIDE_POSTS (same shape as Korean GuidePost).
 * 2. Use a unique English slug (do not reuse Korean slugs).
 * 3. If this is a true translation pair of a Korean guide, set `koSlug`
 *    to that Korean slug so hreflang can link them.
 * 4. Deploy — `/en/guide/{slug}/` is SSG from this list.
